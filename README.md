Certainly, here are the steps you can follow for the tasks you mentioned:

1. Download both data sets from the following links:

o Data Set 1: https://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-media.php

o Data Set 2: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html (Facebook

combined https://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook_combined.txt.gz )


2. After downloading, take some time to explore the contents of the data sets to understand

their structure and information.

3. Create a graph using the networkx library in Python.

4. Print the following information about the graph:

o Number of edges

o Number of nodes

o Number of triangles

o Diameter of graph

o Is the graph is connected or not connected?

5. Calculate and print the minimum and maximum degree of the graph.

6. Print the degrees of all vertices in the graph.

7. Plot the degree distribution of the graph using Python.

8. Calculate and print the betweenness centrality for all vertices, and plot the betweenness

centrality distribution of the graph using Python.

9. Calculate and print the closeness centrality for all vertices, and plot the closeness

centrality distribution of the graph using Python.

10. Calculate and print the clustering coefficient centrality for all vertices, and plot the

clustering coefficient centrality distribution of the graph using Python.

11. Create a combined plot that shows the degree, betweenness centrality, closeness

centrality, and clustering coefficient together in one plot using both Python.

Make sure to follow these steps sequentially, and feel free to ask for further assistance if needed.

Write a report based on it. You need to submit a report and python files.
